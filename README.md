ATGroups
========

Delphi component.  
It 'll be used in SynWrite text editor. It contains 4 page-controls (each based on ATTabs), and maniupulates these pages: depending on Mode prop, it makes visible 1, 2, 3 or all 4 pages, with splitters between them, so you can resize pages. Also 2x2 mode exists: 4 cells grid with pages. Allows to drag-drop tabs between all 4 pages. Tested with TMemo as editor control, of course can be used with other memos or frames. Allows to use SpTBX (option) to theme splitters and ATTabs.
